<p>When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Notes:Open source means that a Github project must be public, closed source means it can be private.
The Open Source MIT License means this is open source, it is also possible to distribute the closed source version but requires credit, such as adding the author’s name in the comments.
The open source GPL license means that the project is open source but the closed source version cannot be distributed.</li>
</ul>

<p>In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We can use the open source MIT license, Creative Commons zero-level open source resources, while complying with the license terms, we need to cite the source, have copyright awareness, infringement will make us pay unnecessary costs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I used the open source MIT license as this allows me to freely use the code and make and distribute closed source versions</li>
</ul>

<p>Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Personal phone number, email address, street address.</li>
</ul>

<p>What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure?’</p>
<ul>
  <li>The exposure of PII will lead to the exposure of personal privacy information, and even the bank card is stolen, and the debt of tens of thousands of dollars on the card for no reason, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A good password is stronger than a bad password because good passwords often use more complex things, such as complex patterns, symbols, numbers and letters alternated, etc. Another step for secondary identity is to send email verification</li>
</ul>

<p>Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Symmetric encryption uses only one key to encrypt or decrypt information, asymmetric cryptography uses a bunch of related keys, a public key and a private key, to prevent unauthorized access</li>
</ul>

<p>Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Customer code is not stored in CodeDeploy, using encryption at rest and encryption in transit, and encryption keys</li>
</ul>

<p>Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Email Phishing, Business Email Compromise, Voice Phishing, SMS Phishing, Spear Phishing.</li>
</ul>
