    "- Once you select your topic make sure it is a csv file and then you want to press on the button that says raw.\n",
    "- After that copy that information and create a file with a name and .csv at the end and paste your information.\n",
    "- Below is a start that you can use for your hacks.\n",
    "- Your goal is to print 2 specific parts from data (example could be like population and country)."
