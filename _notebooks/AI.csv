Jabberwacky,Specialized Projects,Natural Language Processing,,Rollo Carpenter,United Kingdom,1988,"Jabberwacky is a chatterbot created by British programmer Rollo Carpenter. Its stated aim is to ""simulate natural human chat in an interesting, entertaining and humorous manner"". It is an early attempt at creating an artificial intelligence through human interaction. The stated purpose of the project is to create an artificial intelligence that is capable of passing the Turing Test. It is designed to mimic human interaction and to carry out conversations with users. It is not designed to carry out any other functions. Unlike more traditional AI programs, the learning technology is intended as a form of entertainment rather than being used for computer support systems or corporate representation. Recent developments do allow a more scripted, controlled approach to sit atop the general conversational AI, aiming to bring together the best of both approaches, and usage in the fields of sales and marketing is underway.",,,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabberwacky,http://www.jabberwacky.com/
Open Mind Common Sense,Specialized Projects,Knowledge and Reasoning,MIT,"Marvin Minsky, Push Singh, Catherine Havasi",United States,1999,"Open Mind Common Sense (OMCS) is an artificial intelligence project based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab whose goal is to build and utilize a large commonsense knowledge base from the contributions of many thousands of people across the Web. Since its founding in 1999, it has accumulated more than a million English facts from over 15,000 contributors in addition to knowledge bases in other languages. Much of OMCS's software is built on three interconnected representations: the natural language corpus that people interact with directly, a semantic network built from this corpus called ConceptNet, and a matrix-based representation of ConceptNet called AnalogySpace that can infer new knowledge using dimensionality reduction.",,,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Mind_Common_Sense,
P.A.N.,Specialized Projects,Knowledge and Reasoning,,David Benjamin Bowes,,2005,"P.A.N. (A.K.A.: Poetry Analyzer, Textual Analyzer) is a freeware application that allows users to analyze virtually any sort of text (fiction, newspaper, poetry, history text book). It does this by parsing text, determining sentence structure, identifies mood and tones of sentences. Also identifies primary imagery and themes. Poetry Analyzer's website states that a unique analysis of text is accomplished by studying that which is most overlooked, and considered not relevant.",,,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.A.N.,http://pan.sourceforge.net/
PreAct,Specialized Projects,Cognitive Architechture,Applied Systems Intelligence,Norm Geddes,United States,,"PreAct is a cognitive engine technology that is driven both by changes in the state of the world and the intent of the system’s users called associate systems. Associate systems are a knowledge-based system that are designed to work in conjunction with a human operator. An associate system observes the same data about the state of the world as the human operator, combining the information together to reach more abstract and aggregate conclusions about the state of the world. An associate system also observes the actions undertaken by a human operator, combining those actions with the state of the world to determine the operator’s current objectives and activities. Based on the assessment of the state of the world and the activities and objectives of the human operator, the system can, within the bounds of its authority, carry out activities on behalf of the user, make the user aware of events particularly relevant to his activities, and manage the information content of the user’s displays. Associate systems stand in contrast to autonomous systems, in which the software replaces the human operator, and decision-aiding systems, in which the software typically assists the human only when requested. An associate system acts as a teammate to a human operator; it can act without explicitly being ordered while remaining within the bounds of its authority, without taking final control away from the human operator.",,,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PreAct,
Synthetic Environment for Analysis and Simulations,Specialized Projects,Other,Purdue University,Alok R. Chaturvedi,United States,2004,"Purdue University's Synthetic Environment for Analysis and Simulations, or SEAS, is currently being used by Homeland Security and the US Defense Department to simulate crises on the US mainland. SEAS ""enables researchers and organizations to try out their models or techniques in a publicly known, realistically detailed environment."" It ""is now capable of running real-time simulations for up to 62 nations, including Iraq, Afghanistan, and China. The simulations gobble up breaking news, census data, economic indicators, and climactic events in the real world, along with proprietary information such as military intelligence.  The Iraq and Afghanistan computer models are the most highly developed and complex of the 62 available to JFCOM-J9. Each has about five million individual nodes representing things such as hospitals, mosques, pipelines, and people."" SEAS was developed to help Fortune 500 companies with strategic planning. Then it was used to help ""recruiting commanders to strategize ways to improve recruiting potential soldiers"". In 2004 SEAS was evaluated for its ability to help simulate ""the non-kinetic aspects of combat, things like the diplomatic, economic, political, infrastructure and social issues"". Sentient World Simulation is the name given to the current vision of making SEAS a ""continuously running, continually updated mirror model of the real world that can be used to predict and evaluate future events and courses of action.""",,,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_Environment_for_Analysis_and_Simulations,http://www.krannert.purdue.edu/centers/perc/html/aboutperc/seaslabs/seaslabs.htm

Siri,Specialized Projects,Knowledge and Reasoning,Siri Inc.,,United States,2010,"Siri /ˈsɪri/ is an application for Apple Inc.'s iOS which works as a personal assistant and knowledge navigator. The application uses a natural language user interface to answer questions, make recommendations, and perform actions by delegating requests to a set of Web services. The software, both in its original version and as an iOS application, adapts to the user's individual language usage and individual searches (preferences) with continuing use, and returns results that are individualized. The name Siri is Scandinavian, a short form of the Norse name Sigrid meaning ""beauty"" and ""victory"", and comes from the intended name for the original developer's first child.",,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/17/Siri_iOS_7.png/225px-Siri_iOS_7.png,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri,http://www.apple.com/ios/siri/

Commercial versions of SYSTRAN can run on Microsoft Windows (including Windows Mobile), Linux, and Solaris. Historically, SYSTRAN systems used Rule-based machine translation (RbMT) technology. With the release of SYSTRAN Server 7 in 2010, SYSTRAN implemented a hybrid rule-based/Statistical machine translation (SMT) technology which was the first of its kind in the marketplace.",,,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYSTRAN,http://www.systransoft.com/
TD-Gammon,Specialized Projects,Games,IBM,Gerald Tesauro,United States,1992,"TD-Gammon was a computer backgammon program developed in 1992 by Gerald Tesauro at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center. Its name comes from the fact that it is an artificial neural net trained by a form of temporal-difference learning, specifically TD-lambda. TD-Gammon achieved a level of play just slightly below that of the top human backgammon players of the time. It explored strategies that humans had not pursued and led to advances in the theory of correct backgammon play.",,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/OS2_TD-Gammon_Screenshot.png/220px-OS2_TD-Gammon_Screenshot.png,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD-Gammon,
